Primary XBox Controller:
Axes:
  LeftStickX - controls the strafing of the robot, can take -1 to 1 speed
  LeftStickY - controls the drive forward component of the robot drive, also from -1 to 1
  RightStickX - controls the rotation of the robot or yaw of the robot, also -1 to 1
Buttons:
  A Button - used to activate the code that keeps the robot lined up in its current orientation, also used to disable anti-tipping code when we want to go up a scoring platform
  B Button = basically resets what the robot thinks is straight ahead
  RB Button - used to toggle between precise drive and speed drive, almost like shifting
  DPad Angles - used to line the robot up with that specific angle (e.g. line up to 270 degrees)
  
Secondary XBox Controller:
Axes:
  LeftStickY: controls the speed and direction of the tote lifter, also called the slider
  RightStickY: controls the speed andd direction of the winch lifter
